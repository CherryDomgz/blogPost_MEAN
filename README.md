# blogPost_MEAN

A simple blog post created using MongoDB, Express, Angular, and NodeJS.

MONGODB is a no SQL database which stores "Documents" in "collections". It is a powerful database which can easily be integrated into a Node or Express environment.

EXPRESS is a Node framework which simplifies writing server-side code and logic.

ANGULAR is a client-side (browser) framework which allows us to build single-page application (SPA). It handles the user input and communicate with backend services.

NODEJS is a server-side library that listens to requests and sends responses. It interacts with databases and files.
